# My First Python Program 
# -------------------------------

# This is a simple Python script that prints "Hello World!" to the console.
# Save this file as first.py and run it to see the output.


print("Hello World!")

# End of first.py
# You can run this code to see the output.
# To run this code, use the command: python first.py

# Python figures out the type automatically (this is called dynamic typing).
# Use '#' to write comments like this one. Comments are ignored by Python.
# Indentation matters! Python uses whitespace to define blocks of code.
# No curly braces hereâ€”just clean, consistent spacing.
# Strings can be written with single (' ') or double (" ") quotes.
# The 'print()' function displays output to the console.
# It's one of the first things every Python learner uses.
# Python uses '==' to compare values, not '='.
# '=' is for assignment, '==' is for checking equality.


# Python, created by Guido van Rossum and released in 1991, is known for its readability due to its use of significant indentation. It's versatile, powering web apps, data analysis, AI, and more.
# Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language that emphasizes code readability and simplicity.
# Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.
